// A cluster is a CM-by-CN array of CTAs: n varies fastest in cluster rank.
// Each CTA exclusively owns its Tile::kRows x Tile::kCols output tile, its
// accumulator fragments and its result staging. For each K group, (m,0)
// produces A[m], and (0,n) decodes/stages B[n]. Other CTAs borrow these tiles
// through distributed shared memory, copying their contents to CTA-private
// shared tiles before WMMA. The producer policy belongs to this strategy,
// never to the load/decode primitives; it can be replaced independently.
//
// Phase 1: owners write their own shared tiles; __syncthreads then cluster
// sync publishes them to remote readers. Phase 2: consumers copy remote tiles
// into CTA-local shared memory; __syncthreads makes these copies visible to
// WMMA. Phase 3: after all WMMA reads finish, cluster sync retires the remote
// borrows and permits producers to overwrite their tiles in the next K group.
// No CTA returns before the final cluster sync; remote shared addresses never
// escape that collective. All CTAs participate even at partial matrix edges.
// This deliberately keeps the 64-wide K stage and the original CTA WMMA order.
